* For more details, see [Database Instances](./db-instance) and [Database Access](./database-connection).

With a database instance successfully created, you're automatically moved to the list of database instances. It takes a few minutes, or up to a few dozens of minutes, to create a database instance. 

### List of Database Instances

Brief information of database instances can be listed. 
One page shows up to 50 database instances on the list.
